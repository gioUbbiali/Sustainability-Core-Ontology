# Sustainability Core Ontology

## Description

This repository maintains the Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO). SCO is a middle-level ontology, covering the terminology related to the three major theoretical challenges of sustainability [(Ubbiali *et al.*, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z8uqr ):
1) The polysemy of the term sustainability.
2) The relationship between sustainability and sustainable development.
3) The complexity underlying sustainability.
   
SCO is designed to be a pivotal resource upon which to harmonize and integrate ontologies regarding sustainability. The ultimate goal is to establish a family of interoperable sustainability ontologies. Currently, SCO employs [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020) as the upper-level ontology. There are ongoing works to also align SCO with the [Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)](https://ontouml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/ufo.html).  


## Material

Currently, this repository hosts the new working-in-progress version of SCO, SCO V1.1.0. 

SCO V1.1.0. implement SCO V1.0.1. by aligning it to the [Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)](https://ontouml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/ufo.html). SCO V1.0.1. employes only BFO as the upper level ontology. This implementation aims to consolidate SCO as a pivotal resource upon which to harmonize and integrate ontologies regarding sustainability by complementing the BFO-compliant representation of sustainability challenges with a UFO-compliant representation.

SCO V1.1.0. is comprised of two segments: SCO-B (B for BFO) and SCO-U (U for UFO). SCO-B aligns the SCO vocabulary with BFO (as SCO V1.0.0.). SCO-U aligns the SCO vocabulary with gUFO ([UFO implementation in the Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://nemo-ufes.github.io/gufo/)).

SCO V1.1.0. is formalized in [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) and covers three natural languages, English, French, and Italian. SCO V1.1.0. conforms to [OBO-Foundry principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html). 

This project is presently undergoing active development. See the [development protocol](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainability-Core-Ontology/tree/SCO-Alignment-to-UFO/SCO/working%20materials/sco%20development%20protocol) and [related working materials](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainability-Core-Ontology/tree/SCO-Alignment-to-UFO/SCO/working%20materials) for the current status and details.
