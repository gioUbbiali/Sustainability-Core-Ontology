# Sustainability Core Ontology

## Description

This repository maintains the Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO). SCO is a middle-level ontology, covering the terminology related to the theoretical challenges of sustainability …..
SCO is designed to be the pivotal resource on which to harmonize and integrate top-level and domain ontologies in terms of sustainability, with the ultimate goal of establishing a family of interoperable sustainability ontologies….. Currently, SCO employs Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as the upper-level ontology. SCO envisions also aligning with other top-level ontologies in the near future.


## Material

Currently, this repository hosts the structured vocabulary of SCO. The SCO structured vocabulary is a non-exhaustive resource standing as an initial base from which to start to develop SCO. It provides essential terms and relations to include in SCO.

This resource has been developed as part of the ….. (Annex 2 of this publication).

The SCO structured vocabulary includes two spreadsheets: 

1) The SCO structured vocabulary guidelines.
2) The SCO structured vocabulary. 

The methodology for the construction of this structured vocabulary is documented in the ….. and the guidelines spreadsheet.

SCO structured vocabulary Spreadsheets are available in both Excel and CSV formats.


An extended version of SCO formalized in OWL and covering an initial stable set of terms and relations will come soon.
