Annex 2
Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO) 
Description of SCO
SCO aims to be a flexible and easily reusable resource supporting the harmonization of sustainability ontologies. Small in size, SCO will be designed to cover the terminology related to the theoretical challenges of sustainability. It will employ BFO as the upper-level ontology. In doing so, we refer SCO to an internationally recognized and widely used upper-level ontology, providing a shared reference basis with the ontology members of the OBO Foundry. This will facilitate access to the underpinned complexity of themes addressed by these resources. SCO needs equally to connect with SDGIO to bridge sustainability challenges to the UN frame. Sharing the same upper-level ontology will facilitate that. BFO, SDGIO, and SCO compose the foundational structure of the family of sustainability ontologies we propose to create.
General Guidelines
Goal
"In this annex, we present a non-exhaustive structured vocabulary of SCO. By structured vocabulary, we mean a hierarchically organized set of terms complemented by definitions and ""relational expressions"" (Arp et al., 2015, p.65) referring to relations existing among entities those terms refer to. This structured vocabulary proposes some terms we consider necessary to include in SCO. This proposal stands as an initial base from which to start to develop SCO.  We chose relations among those belonging to OBO-Foundry-compliant ontologies. We did not develop novel relations. This will be the subject of further publications."
Methodology
We followed the recommendations of Arp et al. (2015) to create this structured vocabulary. We employed BFO as the upper-level ontology. 
Annex Organisation
This annex is organized as follows. 
▪ A table outlines proposed terms, related definitions, belonging ontologies and related homepages, term URI (if reused from some existing ontology), upper-level classes, identified synonyms and related synonyms, and annotations. By “related synonym”, we mean “ an alternative label for a class or property that has been used synonymously with the primary term name, but the usage is not strictly correct” (http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#hasRelatedSynonym).
"▪ A graphical representation (Supplementary Fig. S1) shows relations existing among entities referred to by those terms. Relations are those hosted within OBO-Foundry ontologies (object properties in OWL). When a relation occurs mutually between two entities, we indicated arrowheads at both ends of the arrow. Instead, we represented symmetric relations with arrows presenting arrowheads at both ends of each side of the arrows. The map provides ontology acronyms for both terms and relations.  In addition, different colors distinguish terms and relations:  light blue -> BFO, light green -> SCO, orange-> INO, and yellow-> RO.  Black arrow-> Is_a relation; green arrow -> other types of relation."
