system;A material entity consisting of multiple components that are causally integrated.;RO;https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002577 ;XXXX;fiat object part;"This class defines a system as a material entity. However, a system is a fiat object (part) (Landgrebe and Smith 2022, p.118). We recommend a revision of this class. Alternative classes for the term ""system"" are proposed by other ontologies. Nevertheless, we decided to choose the RO one, as widely reused among OBO-Foudry-compliant ontologies. Reference: Landgrebe, Jobst, and Barry Smith. 2022.

complex system;A system whose system components interact dynamically and nonlinearly, causing the emergence of a collective nontrivial and self-organized behavior.  No internal/external centralized controls are required.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;Related synonym: socio-ecological system, social-ecological system.;system;"A ""complex system(s)"" class belongs to both IOBC (http://purl.jp/bio/4/id/200906033993517889) and I2SV (https://i2insights.org/index/integration-and-implementation-sciences-vocabulary#complex-systems). The first one does not provide a definition. This term is cardinal in SCO. Thus, we proposed a ""complex system"" class for SCO.  A ""social-ecological system"" class belongs both to EnvThes (http://vocabs.lter-europe.net/EnvThes/21908)  and IOBC (http://purl.jp/bio/4/id/201406059151625127).";;;

system component;An object that belongs to a system.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;system element. Related synonym: system agent, system variable.;fiat object part;"An ""Agent"" class belongs to both CCO (http://www.ontologyrepository.com/CommonCoreOntologies/Agent) and IOF (https://spec.industrialontologies.org/ontology/core/Core/Agent). The definition of the IOF class is adapted from the CCO one. At the moment the IOF class excludes non-human agents and material substances generally considered agents.";;;
complex system component;A system component that belongs to a complex system.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;complex system element. Related synonym: complex system agent, complex system variable.;system component;XXXX;;;
interaction;Interaction is a processual entity that has two or more participants (i.e., interactors) that have an effect upon one another.;INO;https://github.com/INO-ontology/ino; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/INO_0000002;XXXX;process;XXXX;;;
interaction among system components;An interaction that occurs among at least two system components.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;Related synonym:  relation among system components, interconnection among system components.;interaction;XXXX;;;
interaction between system components and the system environment;An interaction that occurs between at least one system component and the system environment of the system to which the system component belongs.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;Related synonym:  relation between system components and the system environment, interconnection between system components and the system environment.;interaction;XXXX;;;
interaction among complex system components;An interaction that occurs among at least two system components of a complex system.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;Related synonym:  relation among complex system components, interconnection among complex system components.;interaction among system components;XXXX;;;
interaction between complex system components and the complex system environment;An interaction that occurs between at least one complex system component and the complex system environment of the complex system to which the complex system component belongs.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;Related synonym: relation between complex system components and the complex system environment, interconnection between complex system components and the complex system environment.;interaction between system components and the system environment;XXXX;;;
stakeholder;A complex system component with a stakeholder role.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;complex system stakeholder, system stakeholder.;complex system component;"Stakeholder is a debated term. To date, a common definition is not available (Keith and Jonathan 2017; Miles 2017). The term is primarily used to refer to humans and human organizations. Nevertheless, humans (and related organizations) may not be the only stakeholders of a complex system.

stakeholder-role;A role whose realization leads the complex system component to be recognized as a bearer, in the belonging complex system, of at least one role (different from the role of stakeholder) and/or disposition (primarily a disposition to benefit/be damaged as being part of that complex system).;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;role;XXXX;;;
perspective;A disposition whose realization leads the complex system component to (re)position itself within and regarding the complex system it belongs to (or a part of it) and possibly act accordingly.;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;XXXX;disposition;"IOBC presents a ""perspective"" class (http://purl.jp/bio/4/id/200906069170620190). Nevertheless, no definition is provided. Further, ""pulsed fluoroscopy"" is a subclass. It does not appear an adequate class to reuse.";;;
