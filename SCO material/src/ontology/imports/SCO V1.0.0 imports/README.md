# SCO Imports

SCO-B remains identical to SCO V1.0.0 regarding imports. Thus, we included this folder to serve as a reference to the original imports.

## Description

This folder contains SCO V1.0.0. imports. To construct the current version of SCO, we imported classes and properties from existing ontologies manually. Nevertheless, we aim to speed up the process of ontology development and comply more consistently with OBO-Foundry practices. In this option, we created import files containing classes and properties reused from existing ontologies. These files could be used for further SCO implementations, following approaches to ontology development and repository organization such as that proposed by the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit). ODK is widely used by OBO-Foundry developers.

Imports from OBO-Foundry ontologies have been fetched using [OntoFox](https://ontofox.hegroup.org/). This folder includes both OntoFox input text files and OWL output ones. Classes and properties reused from the [Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF)](https://github.com/iofoundry/ontology) and the [Common Core Ontologies Suite](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies/tree/master) have been, instead, manually collected with those from the [OBO Format metamodel](http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl) within one comprehensive import OWL file.
