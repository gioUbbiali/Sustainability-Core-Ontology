Barry Smith

The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.

Here, it is provided an explicative example.

Let’s consider that two users, A and B, endorse two different perspectives on sustainability, perspective A and perspective B. These perspectives lead to considering different complex system components as stakeholders of the complex system of interest. 
(This is an explicative example. It could also be the case that there is just one single user who wants to characterize the same entity according to two perspectives on sustainability, or who wants to provide an additional characterization according to a different perspective than the one previously covered.)

We suggest proceeding as follows. 
First, the class “perspective” can be instantiated with two “perspective” individuals, “perspective A” and “perspective B”. These “perspective” individuals will provide descriptions and other relevant information regarding users’ perspectives. Then, two subclasses, “stakeholder – A” and “stakeholder – B”, can be added to the class “stakeholder”. These classes could be created manually and further populated with further subclasses and/or individuals. Alternatively, they can be created by adding SPARQL query results to the ontology, directly as classes or as classes equivalent to some new classes manually created. Subclasses “stakeholder – A” and “stakeholder – B” will cover stakeholders according to the two different user perspectives. Finally, this annotation property can be used to annotate these two subclasses with the corresponding individual “perspective A” and “perspective B”. In proceeding as such, we can highlight the grounding of the role of stakeholder (entity) on perspective (entity) and provide stakeholder characterizations according to the two user perspectives. 
 
This procedure supports establishing indirectly the grounding of certain entities on perspectives. This procedure, however, ensures the possibility to also account for different characterizations of the same entity according to different perspectives, thereby assisting in clarifying and comparing those perspectives.  Further, as a user may change perspective over time, this procedure can be performed whenever the perspective changes. New classes, covering time references, can be created and annotated with new perspectives. This will also assist in tracking users’ perspectives evolution over time. We contemplate the possible creation of an object property to directly model grounding on perspectives as part of future implementations of SCO.""" ;

A sounder and deeper interpretation of the causal role of an agent in an interaction, compared to other participants, is required.

Tentative proposal: a possible direction of implementation is towards a telic vision of agency intended as end-point driven. On this more fundamental neutral vision, a second layer of representation may be constructed to model intentionality, goals, and plans in relation to agency.

Tentative proposal: a possible direction of implementation is towards a telic vision of agency intended as end-point driven. On this more fundamental neutral vision, a second layer of representation may be constructed to model intentionality, goals, and plans in relation to agency.

RO defines the class “system” as a subclass of the “material entity” class. Nevertheless, a system is a fiat object, e.g. an object that is “delimited” according to the perspective of the stakeholder (Landgrebe and Smith 2022, p. 117,118). System delimitation determines the boundaries of the systems, but the stakeholder, however, does not create the system through this delimitation process (Landgrebe and Smith 2022, p. 117,118). 
As this class is extensively reused among ontologies within the OBO-Foundry context, we maintain its current hierarchical position. However, we recommend a revision of this class. There are two possible strategies to consider: 1) to reclassify this class as a subclass of “fiat object part” one or 2) to create a dedicated “fiat object” class that will be a subclass of “material entity” and the superclass for the “system” one (and related subclasses). We leave the discussion open with the intention of engaging with subject matter experts, planning that these modifications may be included in the next release of this resource.
As the environment of a system corresponds to what has not been delimited as part of such a system, these considerations correspondingly also apply to the class “system environment” (at least regarding the system-system environment boundaries)."""@en ,

Despite minor differences, SCO representation of systems and related architecture and composition is compatible with that of the System Core Ontology (Calhau et al., 2024). The system Core Ontology centers on socio-techno systems, primarily pointing to an intention/goal-directed representation of these systems. SCO representation, instead, adopts a more neutral modeling approach for complex systems, seeking to account for a wider range of systems. SCO is also more compact than the system Core Ontology. This is, however, adequate for the current purposes of SCO. 

We envision employing the system Core Ontology as a starting point to extend SCO representation of system architecture, situations, properties, and functions. We also envision possible alignments and reciprocal implementations between these two ontologies.

Nevertheless, implementations seem necessary to deepen the characterization, for instance with regard to representing and measuring the complex system of interest.. Revisions may regard adapting this object property or even further creating a new ad hoc object property. 

The CCO object properties “describes” and “is measurement of” appear other interesting options.

                rdfs:comment """Despite minor differences, SCO representation of systems and related architecture and composition is compatible with that of the System Core Ontology (Calhau et al., 2024). The system Core Ontology centers on socio-techno systems, primarily pointing to an intention/goal-directed representation of these systems. SCO representation, instead, adopts a more neutral modeling approach for complex systems, seeking to account for a wider range of systems. SCO is also more compact than the system Core Ontology. This is, however, adequate for the current purposes of SCO. 

We envision employing the system Core Ontology as a starting point to extend SCO representation of system architecture, situations, properties, and functions. We also envision possible alignments and reciprocal implementations between these two ontologies.

A sounder and deeper interpretation of the causal role of an agent in an interaction, compared to other participants, is required.

Tentative proposal: a possible direction of implementation is towards a telic vision of agency intended as end-point driven. On this more fundamental neutral vision, a second layer of representation may be constructed to model intentionality, goals, and plans in relation to agency. Here, SCO may harmonize and align with UFO-C representation.

A sounder and deeper interpretation of the causal role of an agent in an interaction, compared to other participants, is required.

Tentative proposal: a possible direction of implementation is towards a telic vision of agency intended as end-point driven. On this more fundamental neutral vision, a second layer of representation may be constructed to model intentionality, goals, and plans in relation to agency. Here, SCO may harmonize and align with UFO-C representation.

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other."@en ;

Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.

2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:

(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.

(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.

(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.

In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.""" ;

This is used when the statement/axiom is assumed to hold true &apos;eternally&apos;

## How to interpret (informal)

First the &quot;atemporal&quot; FOL is derived from the OWL using the standard
interpretation. This axiom is temporalized by embedding the axiom
within a for-all-times quantified sentence. The t argument is added to
all instantiation predicates and predicates that use this relation.

## Example

    Class: nucleus
    SubClassOf: part_of some cell

    forall t :
      forall n :
        instance_of(n,Nucleus,t)
         implies
        exists c :
          instance_of(c,Cell,t)

This interpretation is *not* the same as an at-all-times relation""" .

               bfo:IAO_0000116 """This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.

To define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:

 * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? 
 * Is the causal relation regulatory?
 * Is the influence positive or negative?

The first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.

For the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.

For the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.

Each of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types.""" ;
